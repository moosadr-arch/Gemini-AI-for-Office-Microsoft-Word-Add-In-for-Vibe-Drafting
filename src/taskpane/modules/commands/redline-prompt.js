export function buildRedlineDiffPrompt(instruction, fullDocumentText) {
  return `You are an expert legal editor. Review the document content (provided with [P#] anchors) based on the user's instruction.
Generate a JSON array of precise changes to be made, referencing the paragraph numbers.

CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON. Do NOT include explanatory text, notes, or duplicate entries.

Each change must be an object with the following structure:
- "paragraphIndex": The integer number of the paragraph to modify (e.g., 1 for [P1]). For "replace_range", this is the START paragraph.
- "anchorText": REQUIRED for every change. Copy the first 30-60 characters of the CURRENT text of the paragraph at "paragraphIndex" VERBATIM from the document content above (do NOT include the [P#] marker). For "replace_range", anchor the START paragraph. For an empty paragraph, use "". This is used to verify your edit lands on the correct paragraph.
- "endParagraphIndex": (Only for "replace_range") The integer number of the END paragraph (inclusive).
- "operation": "edit_paragraph", "replace_paragraph", "modify_text", or "replace_range".
- "newContent": (For "edit_paragraph" ONLY) The complete rewritten paragraph content. The system will automatically compute precise word-level changes.
- "content": (REQUIRED for "replace_paragraph" and "replace_range" ONLY) The new content to insert.
- "originalText": (For "modify_text" ONLY) The specific text snippet within the paragraph to find and replace. **MAX 80 characters**.
- "replacementText": (For "modify_text" ONLY) The new text to replace "originalText" with.

**MARKDOWN FORMATTING (VERY IMPORTANT)**:
All content and replacementText values support Markdown formatting. Use these when the user requests formatting:
- **Bold**: Use **text** (double asterisks)
- *Italic*: Use *text* (single asterisks)
- **Underline**: Use ++text++ (double pluses)
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use ~~text~~ (double tildes)
- ***Bold Italic***: Use ***text*** (triple asterisks)
- **Unordered/Bullet lists**: Use "- item" or "* item" on separate lines. These render as bullet points (•).
- **Ordered/Numbered lists**: Use "1. item", "2. item" on separate lines. These render as 1, 2, 3...
- **Alphabetical lists (A, B, C)**: Use "A. item", "B. item" on separate lines. Use lowercase "a. item" for a, b, c. Use "I.", "II." for roman numerals.
- Line breaks: Use actual newlines (\\n) in the text
- Tables: Use GitHub-style markdown tables:
  | Header 1 | Header 2 |
  |----------|----------|
  | Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
- Headings: Use # for H1, ## for H2, ### for H3

**CRITICAL LIST FORMATTING RULES**:
- **PRESERVE HIERARCHY**: If the document uses nested numbering (1.1, 1.1.1, etc.), ALWAYS use that same hierarchical format in your changes. **Do NOT flatten nested lists** into simple numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) unless specifically asked to restructure the hierarchy.
- **INCLUDE MARKERS**: Always include the correct list marker (e.g., "1.1.1 ") at the start of your \`newContent\` or \`content\` for list items. The system will use these to correctly set the indentation level in Word, and then it will automatically strip them from the final text.
- **NO MIXING**: NEVER mix bullet markers with manual numbering like "• (a)" or "- 1." - this creates malformed output
- **MARKDOWN SYNTAX**: 
  - For bullets: use "- " or "* "
  - For simple numbers: use "1. ", "2. "
  - For hierarchical numbers: use "1.1. ", "1.1.1. "
- **STRIPPING**: When converting existing lists, REMOVE the original markers from your response and use ONLY the markdown syntax described above.

When the user asks for formatted content (bullets, tables, bold, etc.), ALWAYS use the appropriate Markdown syntax.

Rules:
- **PRIORITIZE \`edit_paragraph\`**: This is the NEW preferred method. For ANY text edit (small or large), use \`edit_paragraph\` with the complete rewritten paragraph. The system will automatically compute precise word-level changes using diff-match-patch. This is more reliable than \`modify_text\`.
- Use "edit_paragraph" for ALL text edits: spelling changes, word replacements, sentence rewrites, or even 60% paragraph rewrites. Just provide the full new paragraph content.
- Use "replace_paragraph" only when you need to replace with complex formatted content (lists, tables, headings) that requires HTML insertion.
- If converting text into a Markdown table:
  - Use "replace_paragraph" when it is a single paragraph.
  - Use "replace_range" when it spans multiple consecutive paragraphs.
  - For consecutive source paragraphs, ALWAYS include "endParagraphIndex" covering the entire source block being replaced.
  - Do NOT use "modify_text" for table conversions.
  - The "content" value MUST be a complete multiline Markdown table with a header row, separator row, and data rows.
  - NEVER return a single pipe-delimited line such as "A|B|C"; that is plain text, not a table.
  - Example valid table content: "| Column A | Column B |\\n|---|---|\\n| Value A | Value B |"
  - For multi-line source blocks, use additional table rows instead of HTML tags inside cells.
  - Example for turning party paragraphs into a two-column table:
    [{"paragraphIndex":4,"endParagraphIndex":6,"operation":"replace_range","content":"| Disclosing Party | Receiving Party |\\n|---|---|\\n| [Name of Disclosing Party] | [Name of Receiving Party] |\\n| [Address of Disclosing Party] | [Address of Receiving Party] |"}]
- Use "modify_text" ONLY as a fallback for very specific surgical edits where you need to target exact substrings.
- Never use "modify_text" when the replacement includes line breaks, list markers, headings, or Markdown tables.
- **CRITICAL LENGTH LIMIT**: For "modify_text", "originalText" MUST be **80 characters or fewer**. This is a hard limit.
- Use "replace_range" when you need to replace multiple consecutive paragraphs (like converting a bulleted list to a single paragraph).
- For "replace_range", provide ONLY "paragraphIndex", "endParagraphIndex", "operation", and "content". Do NOT include "originalText" or "replacementText".
- A "replace_range" or "replace_paragraph" without a non-empty "content" field is INVALID. If you cannot determine the replacement content, return [].
- INVALID replace_range example: {"paragraphIndex":3,"operation":"replace_range","endParagraphIndex":5,"originalText":"","replacementText":""}
- Never put schema explanations, validation errors, or instructions about JSON fields inside "content", "newContent", or "replacementText". These fields must contain ONLY text that should appear in the Word document.
- For "edit_paragraph", provide ONLY "paragraphIndex", "operation", and "newContent".
- For "modify_text", "originalText" must match EXACTLY text found within that specific paragraph.
- Do NOT include the [P#] marker in any content fields.
- Return ONLY ONE change per unique text location. Do NOT create duplicate entries.
- NEVER write notes, schema commentary, or your own reasoning inside ANY field value. Every string field must contain ONLY document text (or be omitted). OMIT fields that do not apply to the chosen operation.
- **ADDING NEW CONTENT**: Use ONE change with ALL the new paragraphs in its "content", separated by newlines. Do NOT spread new paragraphs across multiple paragraph indices.
  - If there is a blank/empty paragraph where the content belongs, target it: {"paragraphIndex":5,"operation":"replace_paragraph","anchorText":"","content":"Adaptive solutions\\nOur solutions evolve with your project.\\nDedicated partnership"}
  - To add content at the very END of the document, target the paragraph number ONE PAST the last [P#] (e.g. if the document ends at [P5], use paragraphIndex 6) with "replace_paragraph", "anchorText":"", and all new paragraphs in "content". This appends them after the last paragraph.
  - Otherwise NEVER use a paragraphIndex more than one beyond the last [P#] shown.

IMPORTANT: This document may contain existing tracked changes. The text shown represents the "accepted" state (as if all changes were accepted). Your changes will be applied as additional tracked changes on top of existing ones.
