### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
Connect your personal Google AI Studio key directly. This ensures complete privacy and allows you to pay Google directly for usage (or utilize their free tier) without the massive middleman markups.

### AI Chat Assistant
Chat naturally with your document. Ask for summaries, clarifications, or rewrites using the latest Gemini models from Google.

### Direct Document Editing
The AI doesn't just suggest changes; it applies them. It rewrites sections with full Track Changes (redline) support, so you always stay in control. You can accept what you like and reject the rest.

### Automated "Glance" Checks
Set up custom criteria—like "Check for Grammar" or "Verify Factual Accuracy"—and get an instant analysis every time you open a document.

### Built-in Research
Need to verify a fact? The AI can perform Google Searches to find the latest information and cite sources directly in your text.

### Custom Personas
Tailor the AI's personality and expertise. Make it a helpful tutor, a strict legal editor, or a creative writing coach.

### Safety & Versioning
Experiment freely with built-in state checkpoints. Easily revert to previous versions of your document if you change your mind.

Transform how you write today with Gemini AI for Office.

## Usage

### Setting Up Your API Key

1. Click the ⚙️ (gear) icon in the top right
2. Enter your Google Gemini API key
3. Click "Save"
4. The key is stored in your browser's localStorage

### Using the Chat Interface

1. Type your question in the chat input box
2. Press Enter or click "Send"
3. Wait for Gemini's response
4. Continue the conversation as needed

**Example questions:**
- "Summarize the key terms of this contract"
- "What are the termination clauses?"
- "Explain the liability section"

### Using the Redline Tool

1. (Optional) Select text in your document for context
2. Enter your editing instruction in the "AI Redline Tool" section
3. Click "Apply Changes as Redlines"
4. The AI will analyze the document and apply changes with track changes enabled

**Tips:**
- Be specific in your instructions
- The AI analyzes the entire document, not just selected text
- Review all changes before accepting them
- Changes are applied with Word's Track Changes feature

### Managing Checkpoints

The add-in automatically saves a checkpoint of the document **before each AI edit**, so you can roll back any change.

**How checkpoints work:**
- A checkpoint is captured automatically before every document-mutating tool runs (with a short throttle so a single multi-edit turn doesn't snapshot repeatedly).
- Checkpoints are stored in the browser's **IndexedDB** (not localStorage), so they are not limited by the ~5MB localStorage quota and can hold large documents.
- The most recent 10 checkpoints are kept; older ones are evicted automatically.

**Revert a change:**
- Click the **Revert** button attached to an AI edit message to restore the document to the state just before that edit.

## Best Practices & Personas

Get the most out of Gemini AI by tailoring it to your specific needs. Here are some optimized setups for different workflows:

### Legal Professional
**System Message:**
> You are assisting an in-house lawyer at AnsonCorp. You will mainly be working on legal documents. You must be specific, precise, and double-check all your advice and suggested changes. Maintain a professional and helpful tone. Be proactive in suggesting and brainstorming.

**Glance Settings:**
- **Summary:** "Please give me a one sentence summary of this document."
- **Favorability:** "Does this contract favor my client or its affiliates? If neutral, leave green."
- **Red Flags:** "Identify any high-risk clauses or unusual terms."

### Student & Academic
**System Message:**
> You are an academic writing tutor. Help me improve my detailed arguments and clarity without writing the essay for me. Focus on structure, thesis strength, and proper tone. Ensure I avoid passive voice where possible.

**Glance Settings:**
- **Thesis Check:** "Does the introduction clearly state a strong thesis?"
- **Clarity:** "Are there any overly complex sentences that should be simplified?"
- **Passive Voice:** "Flag any excessive use of passive voice."

### Creative Writer
**System Message:**
> You are a creative writing coach. Assist with character development, "show, don't tell," and pacing. Do not rewrite my style, but offer suggestions to make descriptions more vivid and dialogue more natural.

**Glance Settings:**
- **Adverb Check:** "Am I overusing adverbs? Point out weak verbs relying on adverbs."
- **Dialogue:** "Does the dialogue sound natural and distinct for each character?"
- **Pacing:** "Is the pacing of this chapter consistent?"

### Business Professional
**System Message:**
> You are a senior executive assistant. You edit for brevity, impact, and actionability. Remove fluff and corporate jargon. Ensure the bottom line (BLUF) is clear.

**Glance Settings:**
- **TL;DR:** "Provide a one sentence executive summary."
- **Action Items:** "Extract all clear action items and deadlines."
- **Tone:** "Is the tone confident and professional?"

> The document reconciliation engine lives in the external [`@ansonlai/docx-redline-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ansonlai/docx-redline-js) package; the add-in talks to it through the `docx-redline-js-integration/` bridge. See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full system map.

## Development

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

### Debugging

- Use browser DevTools (F12) in the task pane
- Check the console for error messages
- Enable verbose logging in `taskpane.js` if needed

### DOCX XML Harness (Testing)

For package-level debugging (without opening Word), use the XML harness:

```powershell
npm run docx:harness -- -Action summary -InputPath "tests/Sample NDA.docx" -AsJson
```

You can also list parts, grep XML, run XPath queries, and extract the package:

```powershell
npm run docx:harness -- -Action list -InputPath "tests/Sample NDA.docx"
npm run docx:harness -- -Action grep -InputPath "tests/Sample NDA.docx" -Pattern "<w:numPr>"
npm run docx:harness -- -Action query -InputPath "tests/Sample NDA.docx" -Part "word/numbering.xml" -XPath "//w:num"
```

See `tests/docx-harness/README.md` for full usage.

### Regression Tests

Tests live in `tests/` as `.mjs` files and run directly with Node (no Word required):

```bash
node tests/<name>.mjs
```

**Reliability suites** (model-variance hardening):

```bash
node tests/change_validation_tests.mjs        # anchor verification + change-set sanitizer
node tests/model_profiles_tests.mjs           # per-model profile resolution
node tests/chat_history_invariant_tests.mjs   # function-call/response history invariants
node tests/checkpoint_store_tests.mjs         # IndexedDB checkpoint store (pure helpers)
node tests/redline_prompt_tests.mjs           # shared redline prompt/schema integrity
```

**Engine / integration suites:**

```bash
node tests/word_redline_runner_table_normalization_tests.mjs
node tests/insert_list_item_level_tests.mjs
node tests/word_list_binding_regression_tests.mjs
node tests/agentic_tools_table_intent_tests.mjs
node tests/include_numbering_behavior.mjs
```

> Note: a few suites that import `@ansonlai/docx-redline-js/index.js` directly
> (e.g. `targeting_helpers_extraction_tests.mjs`, `reconciliation_config_exports_tests.mjs`)
> currently fail with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` because the installed package no
> longer exposes that subpath — a pre-existing issue unrelated to the reliability work.

### AI Eval Harness (Manual — calls the paid Gemini API)

Measures how reliably each model produces a valid, on-target redline change set. This is **not** part of the default test run; it requires a real API key and makes live model calls.

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=... node tests/evals/run-evals.mjs --model gemini-2.5-pro --model gemini-flash-latest
```

- `--model <name>` (repeatable) selects which models to evaluate; `--case <name>` (repeatable) limits to specific cases.
- Cases live in `tests/evals/cases/*.json`. Each loads a fixture `.docx`, runs the production prompt/schema through the model, then scores the returned change set through the same validation pipeline used in the add-in (sanitizer + anchor verification). It prints a per-model pass/fail table and exits non-zero if any case fails.
- The prompt and schema are shared with the add-in via [`src/taskpane/modules/commands/redline-prompt.js`](src/taskpane/modules/commands/redline-prompt.js); `node tests/redline_prompt_tests.mjs` guards that the prompt text stays intact.

The add-in uses Google Gemini models. Users pick the **fast** and **think** (slow) models in Settings; the selection is saved per type. When nothing is selected, [`taskpane.js`](src/taskpane/taskpane.js) falls back to `gemini-flash-latest` (fast) and `gemini-2.5-pro` (slow):

```javascript
// In taskpane.js, loadModel returns the user's saved choice or a default:
function loadModel(type = 'fast') {
  const key = type === 'slow' ? "geminiModelSlow" : "geminiModelFast";
  const storedModel = localStorage.getItem(key);
  if (storedModel && storedModel.trim() !== "") {
    return storedModel;
  }
  return type === 'slow' ? "gemini-2.5-pro" : "gemini-flash-latest";
}
```

Per-model behavior (token limits, temperature, retries, preview-throttle warnings) is centralized in [`src/taskpane/modules/config/model-profiles.js`](src/taskpane/modules/config/model-profiles.js); add a profile there when introducing a new model.

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **API keys in localStorage** - Keys are stored in browser storage (not encrypted)
2. **Production deployment** - Use environment variables or secure key management
3. **HTTPS required** - Office Add-ins require HTTPS in production

## Troubleshooting

### Add-in won't load
- Ensure the dev server is running (`npm start`)
- Check that port 3000 is not in use
- Verify the certificate is trusted
- Try clearing Office cache: `npx office-addin-dev-settings clear`

### API errors
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your Gemini API quota
- Ensure you have internet connectivity
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Track changes not working
- Ensure you have edit permissions on the document
- Try manually enabling Track Changes in Word
- Check that the document isn't protected

### Checkpoints not saving
- Ensure you have a valid document open
- Checkpoints are stored in the browser's IndexedDB; make sure it isn't disabled (e.g. some private-browsing modes) or out of disk space
- A failed checkpoint never blocks the edit — check the browser console for a "Could not save checkpoint" warning

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- [ ] Conversation history persistence
